# Methods

To identify ClinVar variants affecting 5' UTR length, we downloaded the ClinVar variant summary (December 26, 2024; 4,155,543 GRCh38 variants) and extracted 5' UTR genomic intervals from GENCODE v47 MANE Select transcripts. We filtered for indels (deletions, insertions, duplications, and delins variants) where both start and stop genomic coordinates fell within annotated 5' UTR regions, yielding 988 variants. We then applied a minimum size threshold of ≥10 bp to focus on variants with meaningful length changes, resulting in 166 variants. Size changes were calculated using genomic coordinates for deletions and HGVS notation parsing for insertions, duplications, and complex indels. We identified variants causing the UTR to cross biologically relevant length thresholds (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 bp), applying directional logic: deletions cross a threshold when wild-type length exceeds the threshold and mutant length falls at or below it; insertions and duplications cross when the converse is true. Variants were annotated with truncated isoform status based on HeLa ribosome profiling data identifying genes with N-terminally truncated proteins from downstream start sites. Of the 166 variants with ≥10 bp size changes, 17 unique variants crossed at least one threshold.
